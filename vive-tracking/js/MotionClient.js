 * Note that a ws:// and wss:// prefix are proposed to indicate a WebSocket 
 * and a secure WebSocket connection, respectively.
 * Additional examples and notes:
 *   To connect to a server on localhost at port 8080:
 *     ws://localhost:8080
 *   To connect to a server computer having a given IP address on port 8080:
 *     ws://ppp.ppp.ppp.ppp:8080
 * If you are using a router, be sure to use the IP address of the server 
 * computer and not the IP address of the router.  
 * To find the IP address of a server computer do the following:
 *    On Windows, open a command prompt and type ipconfig /all
 *    Read off the IPv4 Address as the preferred IP address of your server.
 * See www.websocket.org for more details and examples of websockets.
