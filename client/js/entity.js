//Classes for movable entities on the Diagram.

/* The base entity class is a wrapper around a JSON object, which adds getters,
setters, and other conveniences. This makes it easy to instantiate an entity
from pure JSON from the server, and to hand only the relevant data back to it.
(The server, for instance, doesn't want to know an entity's current position in
screen space.)

Note that no entity knows how to draw itself; this is handled in Diagram, which
references into EntityDraw. The alternative to this is writing a wide
inheritance tree of classes to only override a draw function. That sounds
messy. But if that would actually be the better way to handle draws, I'll
gladly do that refactor.
